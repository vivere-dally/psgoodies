# Goodies.SemVer

This module provides utility functions that work with [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) strings.



Todo: add to Reset-gSemVer a flag: -All meaning: it will reset all  the identifier, if you have the prerelease: alpha.beta.1.2.3 it will delete it all instead of just the '3'

Add a parameter -Count meaning it will remove as many parts as specified: alpha.beta.1.2.3 with count 3 will get us the result alpha.beta
